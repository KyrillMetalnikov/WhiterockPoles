# About

MySQL database implementation of local government traffic light records (Streetlight and Traffic Signal sample data.xlsx). 

Design emphasis was placed on eliminating data field duplication and documenting implementation specifics to create consistent data formatting and better facillitate future data entry. Included in the implementation are procedures and triggers to support data entry, modification of existing records, as well as querying by an extensive set of traffic light properties.

Project was designed as a group but implemented alone.
